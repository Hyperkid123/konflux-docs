= Getting started with the CLI

{ProductName} provides a user-friendly web interface for managing your resources. However, for advanced users or those comfortable with the command line, kubectl offers a powerful way to interact with the platform.

.Prerequisites

* An up-to-date kubectl binary installed on your machine. You can verify the version using `kubectl version`.

* Alternatively, the `oc` binary (used with OpenShift) is also compatible with {ProductName} in most cases.

*Granting Cluster Access (Platform Engineer Role)*

. *Cluster Configuration (Platform Engineer):*  A Platform Engineer (PE) with the appropriate permissions needs to configure your {ProductName} instance for kubectl access. This typically involves enabling the Kubernetes API server and generating a cluster configuration file (often named `kubeconfig`).

. *Template kubeconfig File (Platform Engineer):* The PE will likely provide a template `kubeconfig` file containing the necessary connection details. This file serves as a starting point for individual user access.

*User Setup*

. **Obtain the Template kubeconfig:**  Once the PE has configured cluster access and created the template file, you'll receive a copy from your PE or IT team.

. *Personalize Your kubeconfig:**  Make a copy of the template file and personalize it with your unique user context information. This might involve setting environment variables or editing the file directly as provided by the PE.

. *Use kubectl:**  With your personalized `kubeconfig` in place, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to interact with your {ProductName} cluster. 

Whether you need to enable CLI access, or to gain access once it is available, refer to the relevant procedures below. 

== Enabling CLI access for {ProductName}

.Procedure

. Follow link:https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/admin-guides/authentication/oidc/oidc-keycloak/[these instructions] to set up Keycloak as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. Be aware that, when installing {ProductName}, you already set up a Keycloak server and created a realm called `redhat-external`. 
. In your preferred text editor, use the `kubeconfig` template below to create a template specific to your organization. Be sure to provide the following values, specific to your organization, for the corresponding fields in the template file:
.. The API URL for your cluster, for example: `https://api-toolchain-host-operator.apps.stone-prd-host1.wdlc.p1.openshiftapps.com`
.. Your OIDC issuer URL, for example: `https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external`
.. Your OIDC client ID, for example: `rhoas-cli-prod`

. Make this template `kubeconfig`, now specific to your organization, available to users of your {ProductName} instance.

.Prerequisites

* Install link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[`kubectl`]
* Install link:https://github.com/int128/kubelogin[`kubelogin`]

.Procedure

. Get the template `kubeconfig` file for your organization's instance of {ProductName}. A PE should be able to provide you with this.
. Using your preferred text editor, in your copy of the template `kubeconfig`, replace <username> with your {ProductName} username.
. Use one of these two methods for making your `kubeconfig` file accessible to the `kubectl` CLI tool:
.. In your CLI, run the following command:
+
[source]
--
export $KUBECONFIG=<path to your kubeconfig file>
--
+
.. Or, overwrite the file located at `~/.kube/config` with your `kubeconfig` file.
. Verify your available contexts by running the following command in your CLI. You should see the `konflux` context.
+
`kubectl config get-contexts`
. Still in your CLI, set `konflux` as the default context:
+
`kubectl config set-context konflux` 
. Trigger a round trip from your machine to the cluster and back, to verify the connection:
+
`kubectl get cm`
